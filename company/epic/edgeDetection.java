Edge Detection
Two-dimensional array representation of an image can also be represented by a one-dimensional array of W*H size, 
where W represent row and H represent column size and each cell represent pixel value of that image. 
You are also given a threshold X. For edge detection, you have to compute difference of a pixel value with each of itâ€™s adjacent pixel and find maximum of all differences. 
And finally compare if that maximum difference is greater than threshold X. if so, then that pixel is a edge pixel and have to display it.
